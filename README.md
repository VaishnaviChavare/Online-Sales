# Online-Sales

Insights:

March saw the highest order volume (2 orders) and a high revenue of ₹460.95.

May had the highest single-month revenue (₹600.00) despite just 1 order, suggesting a high-value product was sold.

There was steady activity between January and July 2023, with 1–2 orders per month.

No sales were recorded for August to December 2023 in the current sample — might need a larger dataset for full-year analysis.
